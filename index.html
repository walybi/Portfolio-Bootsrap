        </div>
        <hr>

        <div class="row">
            <p> Originally from Burkina Faso, a small country located in west Africa, I moved to the US in 2012
                after
                completing my high school degree. Coming to America, I did not know any English but as always, I was
                eager to learn and in three months I was able to stand up in front of a class to give an oral presentation. </p>
            
            <p> I spent my first three months in the US in a college town called Eugene, in Oregon. Then I moved to
                New
                York where I spent the next seven years going to school. I first studied English for another three
                months, then I started my academic program in Electronics engineering Technology at the city
                university
                of New York in the Bronx. I graduated in May 2015 and pursued a Bachelor in electrical Engineering
                at
                the State University of New York at New Paltz. I graduated from New Paltz in May 2019. One month
                later,
                I decided to leave New York and adventure in the west coast precisely in Seattle, WA. </p>
            
            <p> Why Seattle? A simple google search showed that Seattle is one of the fast growing city in the US
                with
                lots of tech Jobs. Plus I have visited the city before moving to New York and also in spring 2016
                and I
                fell in love with the nice views, the nice weather and the modern houses. So, Without hesitation, I
                packed my staff and took off. </p>
            
            <p> Once in Seattle, I found out that most of the high paying jobs are in the programming world, plus I
                have
                always wanted to learn how to code. So I decided to go for a coding Bootcamp and the only one
                flexible
                with my schedule was the UW-Bootcamp. </p>
            
            <p> Now I am ready to put in use everything I have learned these past years to the profit of a great comapny. Or maybe create my own thing!!!</p>
